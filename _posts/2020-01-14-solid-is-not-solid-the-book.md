As of now, you can buy my <a href="http://bit.ly/not-solid">new 70-page snarky take on the SOLID Principles</a> (containing <strong>all new material, I swear</strong>) for just <strong>$4.99</strong> with code <code class="discount-code">NDNOTSOLID</code>. It was originally a re-packaging of [the][1] [five][2] [posts][3] [I wrote][4] [last year][5], but I decided to rewrite the entire thing in the snarkiest way possible in a book called "SOLID is not Solid: Five Object-Oriented Principles to Create a Codebase Everyone will Hate":

>Do you know what I had to do to write and publish this? The hardest part was figuring out how to change fonts in LaTeX. 20 years ago the hardest part would’ve been to find a publisher and decide to be OK with a 10% royalty rate. Today, I don’t need anyone’s permission to make a book. On paper!
> 
> It turns out that almost everything you’ve been told about how to design software went through the same vetting process (by which I mean learning LaTeX).

There's also a chapter of six quick takedowns of some of Agile's silliest catch phrases:

> “KISS” is often used when code is complex. KISS stands for Keep It Simple Stupid. You know what? I’m not stupid. I’m just not. And neither are you. I don’t need to be insulted in order to discuss code.

<a href="http://bit.ly/buy-not-solid">Buy it now!</a>, and don't forget code <code class="discount-code">NDNOTSOLID</code> to get a
dollar off at checkout.
