Most websites are a mess of decoration, hijacking, dark-UX, and general chaos.  Few designs serve the needs of the user.  One way
to do that is to embrace websites for what they are, by adopting a form of [_brutalism_ for web design][link]:

> * Content is readable on all reasonable screens and devices.
> * Only hyperlinks and buttons respond to clicks.
> * Hyperlinks are underlined and buttons look like buttons.
> * The back button works as expected.
> * View content by scrolling.
> * Decoration when needed and no unrelated content.
> * Performance is a feature.

If every website adopted these guidelines, the web would be fast and readable, our batteries would have much power at the end of
the day, and we'd all be a lot happier.
