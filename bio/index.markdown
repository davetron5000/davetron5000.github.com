I'm a Director of Engineering at Stitch Fix, having helped grow the engineering team from 3 to 100+, monolith to microservices, startup to IPO.  I'm also an author of several programming books such as [“Agile Web Development with Rails 5.1”][railsbook], [“Rails, Angular, Postgres, and Bootstrap”][fullstackbook], [“The Senior Software Engineer”][sweng], and [“Build Awesome Command-Line Applications in Ruby 2”][clibook].  I've spoken at regional and national programming conferences and have over 20 years of experience in the industry.

I value delivering results and business value, and see technology as a powerful tool in service to those goals.  I've delivered
results to users using Ruby, C, Java, SQL, Messaging, and Microservices, and look forward to using whatever is within my means to
make technology work.  I fight for the users.  Also a huge fan of Peter Hook and the Oxford comma.
