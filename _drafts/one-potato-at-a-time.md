My wife and I recently went to Culebra, Puerto Rico, which is a small island off the east coast of the main
island. To get there, we fly about 30 minutes in a small 8-seat plane.  We sat in the first row behind the pilot.  Once everyone's piled in, the pilot says we have to make a stopover in Vieques (another island off the south east coast).  That's about a 30 minute ride, and then probably 20 minutes to Culebra from there.

We land in Vieques, offload a few people and the pilot waits for clearance to take off.  He shakes his head and
says "They tell me to go to Vieques, I go to Vieques. They say fly to Culebra next, I fly to Culebra.  One potato
at a time".

The implication is that he has no idea where he's headed in the grand scheme of things, and he just deals with
whatever is in front of him at any given time.  It's a great way to deal with navigating the unknown and I think
it's a perfect metaphor for the the positive and negative of agile software development.

Dave Thomas, author of the Pragmatic Progammer and signatory of the Agile Manifesto defines Agile thusly:

1. Find out where you are
1. Take a small step towards your goal (and if there are multiple choices here, take the path of least regret, or the one that makes future change easier)
1. Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
1. Repeat

If you've ever been a software consultant, or otherwise had to build software for someone that fundamentally
doesn't understand it, this is great advice.  Don't worry what comes next, just solve the problem in front of you. One potato at a time.

It's important to understand the context of this as a defense mechanism against uncertainty.  It's a great hack
for delivering usable software without any plan.

But is this the best way to write software?

The problem that happens with one potato at a time is you end up with developers like the airline pilot above:
resigned to their lot in not really knowing what they are doing beyond the task in front of them.  I call
engineers in this mode _ticket takers_, because their workflow is almost always pulling some ticket off a queue
and doing it.  They aren't required (or often able) to see the larger plan or context.

The problem with ticket takers is that someone, somewhere has to figure out what the tickets actually are.  It
also breeds out agency and initiative in a team, as they eventually look at their backlog as a never ending list
of work to do, disconnected from any plan, strategy, or vision. One potato at a time.

And this is what Agile is great for - getting work done when there is no plan, strategy, or vision.  But *should*
there me a plan, stragegy, and vision?  What if there are?  Do we need to work one potato at time then?

In [Articulating a Vision](https://naildrivin5.com/blog/2017/01/17/articulating-a-vision.html), I wrote:

> Your primary goal is to get others to really understand your vision at the level you do. With that understanding, you can get feedback to refine that vision, get help in further articulating it, and, most importantly, get others to help you execute on it.

When the team understands the vision, agrees with the strategy to achieve it, and can see the plan for executing
on that strategy, that team can accomplish great things without being spoonfed tickets, or having to trudge
through a never-ending backlog.

This doesn't mean the team can go into a hole for six months and come out with perfect software, but it means they
can work smarter, since they have real context.  They can be trusted to produce intermediate results without being
infantalized.

And make no mistake, ticket-taking *is* infantilizing.  It means that no engineer is trusted with anything that
will take more than a few days.  This is not the way to achieve the best results, even if it is the only way to be
successful working for people that don't understand technology or software.

Before you start making JIRA tickets, creating a product backlog, or executing any other XP and Agile nonsense,
take a step back.  What is the vision for what you are trying to achieve?  What is the underlying strategy?
What's your plan?  Do the people involved understand technology and software development?  Can you trust anyone on
the team withi more than a few days work?

I've worked with teams where the engineers could easily be trusted, and the product stakeholders undrstood
technology.  We didn't need tickets, backlogs, chores, or any of that.  The engineers had agency to solve problems
the way they thought best. The stakeholders were interested in—and could understand—the nuances with various
technical approaches.  When problems came up, they weren't passive-aggressively put into the backlog in hopes of
being forgotten.  We talked about the utility of solving them…or not.

Product development was done by a team with true partnership, each respecting what the others brought to the
table.  Not everyone can work like this.  Sometimes engineers would be hired that really did have to be given
tickets in order to get work done.  They were not effective.  Sometimes project stakeholders would be hired that
didn't understand technology and weren't interested in learning how it could help them do their job. They made
problems.

It's hard to hire these people, but if you can, it beats working one potato at a time.
