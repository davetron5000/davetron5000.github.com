<h2 class="f4 center">I am donating 50% of my royalties</h2>
<p>
  Police Brutality is <strong>not OK</strong>. Systemic Racism is <strong>not OK</strong>. These issues are inexorably linked and this, too, is <strong>not OK</strong>.  The United States has a long history with both systemic racism as well as police brutality. This is <strong>not OK</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  I cannot put my body on the line, nor can I address the problem through voting (I live in Washington, DC and have no representation in Congress).
</p>
<p>
  As such, I will be donating 50% of the royalties I make from sales of my self-published books from now until the end of 2020 to <a href="https://bailproject.org">The Bail Project</a>.
</p>
<h3 class="f5">How Will This Work?</h3>
<p>
  I will post my revenue, royalties, and donations here periodically. At least monthly. If you would like to donate to <a href="https://bailproject.org">The Bail Project</a>, but don't need technical non-fiction, please follow the link and donate directly.
</p>
<h3 class="f5">If You Don't Want This Money To Be Donated…</h3>
<p>
  …don't buy my books and don't follow me.
