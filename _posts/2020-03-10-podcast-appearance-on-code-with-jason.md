I was fortunate to join [Jason Swett](https://www.codewithjason.com) on his Podcast, [Code with
Jason](https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-with-jason-podcast/) to talk about my upcoming book [Sustainable Web
Development with Ruby on Rails](https://sustainable-rails.com).

I had a great time chatting through some of the ins and outs of making a mess in a Rails app. [Check it out][link]
in your podcast player of choice.
