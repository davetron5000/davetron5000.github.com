I recently did an [interview][link] with local DC dev community [Hatchpad](https://dmv.myhatchpad.com) about the dangers of blindly applying patterns, and how not-helpful the SOLID principles are.

One thing mentioned that isn't in the [SOLID book][solid-book] is that we all need to understand not just the
advice we're given, but *who* is giving it.  What is the actual experience of the person telling us how we should
code?

> If someone is giving out advice I want to know – “Have you done that? Have you experienced this problem, or is it just theoretical?”

I try *very* hard to only give advice based on my actual experience, and I try to contexutalize that experience as
much as I can to avoid it being mis-applied.  It's not easy and I don't always do a great job, but I'm very aware
of it. Even if my advice boils down to "it worked for me, anyway", that's better than "I haven't tried it, but it seems neat".
