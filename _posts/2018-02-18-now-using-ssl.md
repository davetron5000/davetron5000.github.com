Since [Chrome is marking non-SSL sites as insecure soon](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html), I finally got around to moving my site's hosting from GitHub Pages to AWS. Setting up a static website using CloudFront and S3 is surprisingly easy.  I'll write up how to do it in a future post, but for now, enjoy the sweet security of SSL :)
