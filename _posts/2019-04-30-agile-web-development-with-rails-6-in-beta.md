I'm speaking at RailsConf, and the beta of the next verison of the seminal [Agile Web Development with Rails][link] is now out in
beta.

My contribution thusfar was a chapter on ActionMailbox and ActionText, which I enjoyed learning about and would likely use on a
new Rails app if I were building it today. If you want a great intro to Rails, buy this book!
