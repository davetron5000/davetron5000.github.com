I've updated [Webpack from Nothing][link] to use Webpack 4.  I also ditched Karma for Jest, and I'm not sure if that was the right call, but my opinions of Webpack haven't change, really.  While it does work, it has terrible ergonomics and its behavior is still just as opaque and unpredictable as it has been.

I firmly believe the JavaScript community would be better served by small interoperable tools that communicate over a well-defined protocol, instead of the half-monolithic, plugin-ridden systems that exist now. Webpack isn't unique here.  That all said, the docs for Webpack have gotten better and most of what's documented does work as advertised.
