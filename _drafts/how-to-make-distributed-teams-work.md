I periodically talk to people who wonder how distributed teams and remote actually works and what it takes to be
successful.  The very short answer is that there must be trust, that trust must be replenished, and the team has
to be comprised of people that can work effectively without being co-located. I want to talk some about each of
these.

Making a distributed team work is not necessarily easy, but it's not that much different than just having an
effective team regardless of geography.  I would argue that the larger the team, the more a well-functioning
distributed team looks like a well-functioning co-located team.

That said, there are real challenges to understand.  One is to be cognizant of how trust is built and
maintained, and to be active in the cultivation of that trust. The other is more practical, which is to make
sure the team members can function in a distributed environment, because not everyone can.

First, let's talk about trust.

## Build and Maintain Trust

When I talk about trust, I find it helpful to be explicit about *what* is being trusted, specifically what do I
trust you to do, what do you trust me to do, etc.  It's fine and normal to not completely trust people to do
everything.  Instead, you need to be clear on *what you trust your fellow co-workers* to be able to do, and then
decide if that is sufficient.  For example, if I am trusted to write Ruby given a clear specification, but NOT
trusted to write Ruby given a vague problem statement, that might be OK if you only need me to write to a spec.

So, when thinking about trust, we can evaluate it like so.  I trust you with a thing if:

* you are *competent*, i.e. you can do that thing
* you are *consistent*, i.e. you can always do that thing
* your *motivations* are good, i.e. you do that thing for the right reasons

For example, you should trust me to write Ruby code given a vague problem statement, because a) I can, b) I have
done so many many times, and c) I do this because I want to solve the vaguely-defined problem.

A counter example might be asking me to write Clojure given a spec.  You should not trust me to do that because
a) I cannot, b) and thus have never done so, and c) would likely only do it for money.

It's also worth pointing out that trusting me to write Clojure is a different than than trusting me to *learn to
write* Clojure.

Given this definition, you can quickly get a sense of what you trust your co-workers, your boss, etc. to be able
to do and what you don't trust your co-workers or boss with *and why*.

So what has this to do with remote engineering teams?

It has to do with how we build and maintain trust in the face of ambiguity.  When we see each other in person
every work day, this implicitly creates some basic level of trust about some basic things.  We relate to each
other as people very easily when we experience each other in the flesh.

Said another way, if we take no explicit action to build and maintain trust with one another, but we see each
other every day, we somehow manage to maintain a level of trust. And when we are distributed, thus not together
very often, that trust never gets cultivated, or quickly drains away the longer we are apart.

And so, one of the two things to make a distributed team work is to make sure that everyone is explicitly
building and maintain trust with each other.  It will not come "for free" and must be cultivated actively.

How do you do this?

There is no one magic thing, you have to do many things.  Seeing each other in person every once in a while
helps and I recommend it, however it is not strictly necessary if you are cultivating trust in other ways.

Thinking back to the three parts of trust, what it means is that the team members must reinforce and demonstrate
their competence, consistency, and motivation explicitly to each other.

A great way to do that is to do good work, and to do it often. You know those studies around contiuous delivery,
and those agile processes that we often find ourselves wrapped up in?   When properly executed, you will build
trust.

Continuous Delivery means that value is being delivered to users frequently.  That demonstrates both competence
and consistency.  This concept is fractal.  On your team, individuals doing great work that provides value and
getting it to users quickly will build individual trust.  If your team is doing that on a larger level, then
your team is trusted by outside observers.  It even goes all the way up to the organizational level.

Motivation is harder to demonstrate, but this leads to another technique, which is to make sure to relate to
each other as human beings.  If you consider every interaction between two or more people, that interaction
could be made up of three parts:

* What is going on with you
* What is going on with the other person
* Whatever the topic of conversation is

When we get rushed, or when we don't know each other, or when trust is flagging, we tend to default to focusing
only on whatever topic needs to be discussed, and we don't spend time on what's going on with each other.

This doesn't have to be a deeply revealing act of personal authenticity, but there *is* value in relating to
your co-workers and boss as a person and not just an employee. This can communicate your personal motivations
and, you guessed it, build trust.

You spend a lot of your work day with these other people, and the more everyone thinks of each other as whole
persons and not disembodied voices on a conference call, the better for everyone.

The main point is that trust should be a thing that is explicitly talked about, and everyone should have it top
of mind to make sure they are not missing oppotunities to build it, or detectring when they are losing it.

Now, despite all of this, there are practical matters to working on a distributed team.  You can have all the
trust in the world, but if half the team cannot make decisions without an in-person conversation, your
distributed team won't function.  Mean, the team must be capable of working in a dstributed fashion.

## Team Members Must Be Capable of Working in a Distributed Fashion

A small team, sitting in a room together can communicate very efficiently.  One person can turn to the other and
have a quick conversation that might take more time over email or chat.  It is this interaction model that
people tend to fear losing when they consider remote work.

But think about how this scales.  When the team cannot fit into one room, the people you want to have a quick
chat with might not be physically near you.  And beyond as very small size, the labor is divided amongst team
members and so your need to discuss something right now might derail another person's work.  This sort of
collaboration model leads to a loss of productivity because people's work will not sync up to allow having
quick chats without interruption.

Also consider the way decisions are made and communicated.  In a small room, everyone hears the discussion and
the conclusion.  The decision is obvious to everyone effected by it because they are all there to hear it.  At
even a medium-sized team, this no longer works.  Instead, decisions get made with a subset of the people
affected by it, and the way that decision gets communicated, if done verbally, is subject to the classic
"telephone game".  Information gets lost or skewed, and you end up with a team that is not aligned.

So, at even a moderate scale, the "open collaboration" model creates inefficiency and confusion.  But there is a
size where it works.  And it is that size that a distributed team can feel like more work, because a distributed
team literally cannot work by having ad-hoc conversations in a room.

What this means is that at pretty much  any size, a distributed team must communicate in text.  Sure, the group
can jump on a call to discuss something that's hard to type out, but by and large all decisions and all
information has to end up in writing, because there is no other way to communicate.

Not everyone is good at working like this.  Not everyone *can* work in an environment where decisions have to be
written down and distributed in text.  Not everyone expresses themselves effectively in writing.

And these people, if they cannot change, will not work effectively in a distributed team.

To say this another way, a distributed team has an additional job requirement for everyone, which is the ability
to work effectively in an asynchronous, written, structured way.

And what this means is that you must hire for this.  The most efficient and brilliant programmer in the world
will crash and burn on a distributed team if they can only collaborate by talking.

I should note there is an analog for this on a co-located team. A person who struggles to process verbal
information or who cannot easily express themselves verbally is not going to be effective on a team that is
co-located where all decisions get made by talking.
